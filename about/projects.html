provides a promising paradigm for large scale and highly complex data
sensing due to the prominent advantages such as low cost, good
scalability, pervasive application scenarios. The incentive mechanisms
should not only stimulate the users to participate in the crowdsensing,
but also improve the profit of platform, data quality, the ability of
privacy protection, and the adaptability for various complex
application scenarios. However, existing study of incentive mechanism
design for crowdsensing is insufficient. Focusing on and breaking
through three key problems in crowdsensing: data quality formalization,
privacy protection based incentive mechanism framework, and user
cooperative behavior abstraction and compatibility model construction,
this project comprehensively utilizes the achievements and powerful
tools from auction theory, contract theory, graph theory, algorithm
design theory, frugality theory, voting theory, and online social
network to studiy the design theory and methods of frugality theory
based incentive mechanisms, the quality aware incentive mechanisms,
privacy protection based incentive mechanisms, and incentive mechanisms
towards complex tasks. The objective of this project is providing the
innovative design methods of algorithmic game theory based monetary
incentive mechanisms for crowdsensing, improving the business value,
data quality, privacy protection ability, and handling ability for
complex application scenarios of crowdsensing system. The research
results of this project are expected to provide theoretical basis and
technical supports for the development and popularization of novel
crowdsensing applications.</font></span></a></p>

                  <span class="section"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">With the development of society,
the desire for thorough sensing is more and more strong. As a new
sensing mode, crowd intelligence sensing has been a hot research area
because of prominent advantages, such as wide coverage, low cost and
strong scalability. As so far, the study of crowd intelligence sensing
is still in the initial stage, and the theory and method of closely
related research area are inefficient in such scenario. Focusing on
three key problems in crowd intelligence sensing: social behavior
abstract, participant recruitment and opportunistic data collection,
this project research the abstract model and method for user behavior
based on mobility profile, maps the actual behavior to calculable and
verifiable virtual behavior space; We explore the mechanism of
participant recruitment, design the recruitment framework based on
social behavior analysis, and propose coverage and reputation based
recruitment respectively; Based on the data collection mode which
guided by the user behavior characteristics, low load distributed
routing protocols and algorithms are proposed. Besides the theoretical
proof and simulation, we also develop a social behavior analysis based
haze monitoring crowd intelligence sensing system in order to test the
efficiency of our study. The project concentrates on reducing data
sensing cost, expanding the sensing coverage, increasing the user
engagement and improving data quality and data collection performance
in crowd intelligence sensing. The results of project will provide
theoretical basis and technical support for development and
popularization of crowd intelligence sensing applications.</span></font></span></p>
